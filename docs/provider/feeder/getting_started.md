Now that you have configured your feeder, it's time to start it up.

The service can be served in 2 different ways:

- as a [standalone binary](#run-the-binary)
- as a [Docker service](#run-the-container)

Depending on your preferences and needs you may want to proceed in one or the other way.

If you already know how to start a feeder and are interested to securely connect it to a remote daemon (with macaroons/TLS enabled) take a look [here](#securely-connect-feeder-to-daemon).

## Run the binary

If you want to run your feeder as a standolne binary, you can download the latest version for your platform (linux or macOS) from the [release page](https://github.com/tdex-network/tdex-feeder/releases).

If you want to build it from source, you can follow the steps described in the [README](https://github.com/tdex-network/tdex-feeder#build-it-yourself) of the public repository. This requires [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) to be installed.

Now that you have the binary, it's time to execute it:

```bash
# This requires having a config.json file in the same directory of the binary
$ ./feederd-linux-amd64


# This explicitly defines where to file the config file - it can have a different name!
export FEEDER_CONFIG_PATH=~/.feeder-config/config.example.json
$ ./feederd-linux-amd64
```

## Run the container

If you want to serve your feeder as a dockerized service, just download the latest image locally and run the container:

```bash
# Pull the image from the github container registry
$ docker pull ghcr.io/tdex-network/feederd:latest

# Run the service
$ docker run -rm --name feederd -v $HOME/.feeder-config/config.json:/config.json --network <network_with_tdexd_running> -d ghcr.io/tdex-network/feederd:latest
```

Make sure to use the proper *rpc_address* in the config file to connect to your daemon. For example, if you're serving the daemon as a docker container named `tdexd` you will set it to `tdexd:9000` taking advantage of the Docker internal DNS resolution. 
:::tip
It's always a good practice to create a custom network where to run your inter-connected containers in order to isolate them.

## Securely connect feeder to daemon

If you want to connect your feeder to a daemon with macaroon/TLS enabled on the Operator interface you have to:

1. Be sure you followed the [instructions](../daemon/getting_started/run_prod.md) to configure your daemon properly
2. Copy the `price.macaroon` and `cert.pem` generated by the daemon at startup (they can be found in daemon's datadir) to the machine hosting the feeder
3. Add the *macaroons_path* and the *tls_cert_path* of the file mentioned above and change the *rpc_address* for the target daemon in the feeder's config file

#### Example for standolone feeder

```bash
$ export $FEEDER_CONFIG_PATH=~/.feeder-config/config.json
$ ./feederd
```

Feeder's config file:

```json
{
    "price_feeder": "kraken",
    "interval": 300000,
    "markets": [
      {
        "base_asset": "6f0279e9ed041c3d710a9f57d0c02928416460c4b722ae3457a11eec381c526d",
        "quote_asset": "ce091c998b83c78bb71a632313ba3760f1763d9cfcffae02258ffa9865a37bd2",
        "ticker": "XBT/USDT",
        "targets": [
          {
            "macaroons_path": "/home/user/.feeder-config/price.macaroon",
            "tls_cert_path": "/home/user/.feeder-config/cert.pem",
            "rpc_address": "provider.mydomain.com:9000"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

#### Example for dockerized feeder

```bash
# Note that the files must be mounted as volumes of the container!
$ docker run -rm -d \
    --name feederd \
    -v $HOME/.feeder-config/config.json:/config.json \
    -v $HOME/feeder-config/price.macaroon:/price.macaroon \
    -v $HOME/feeder-config/cert.pem:/cert.pem \
    ghcr.io/tdex-network/feederd:latest
```

Feeder's config file:

```json
{
    "price_feeder": "kraken",
    "interval": 300000,
    "markets": [
      {
        "base_asset": "6f0279e9ed041c3d710a9f57d0c02928416460c4b722ae3457a11eec381c526d",

        "targets": [
          {
            "macaroons_path": "/price.macaroon",
            "tls_cert_path": "/cert.pem",
            "rpc_address": "provider.mydomain.com:9000"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

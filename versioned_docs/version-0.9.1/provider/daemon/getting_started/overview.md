The daemon can be served in one of the following ways:
 * [Docker container](run_docker.md)
 * [Standalone application](run_standalone.md)

 Docker-compose box for production
 * [TDEX Box](https://github.com/tdex-network/tdex-box) (docker-compose)

After the daemon is up and running you need to [configure the operator CLI](configure_cli.md) to be able to use it to play with your daemon.

If you have already done all this steps, you are ready to [initialize and unlock the daemon's internal HD wallet](../init_daemon.md).
